# Sign-Up-Form-Daily-UI
100 Days Daily UI Projects

100 Days Daily UI Projects is a Practical Course aimed at Shaping your Basic frontend coding skills.
The projects are sent through your Mail as task for you to acomplish. 

The First task is to create a Sign-up Form for anything.

I learnt a lot from this project. It gave me an overview and a better understanding at how HTML forms work.
